You can access the current version of the book in the [chapters directory](/chapters) or in PDF format (both Light and Dark modes are available) by [clicking here](https://github.com/ishtms/learn-nodejs-hard-way/releases). Note that this version includes the current release of the content, and is not the final version.

> This book is still in a very early stage. It contains an insignificant portion of the total content that the book is supposed to cover. Thereâ€™s going to be 0 dependencies for our [backend framework](https://github.com/ishtms/velocy), as well as our [logging library](https://github.com/ishtms/logtar). Everything will be done using vanilla Node.js, the hard-way (the best way to learn).

## Note

If you're not familiar with javascript, you may also check out my other repository - [Learn Javascript - The Easy Way](https://github.com/ishtms/learn-javascript-easy-way) that takes you on a deep and a fun journey into Javascript - from the very basics to the advanced concepts that you'd ever need, without diving into too much theory. Only practical code examples.

To master a new concept, it's often best to begin from the ground up. This isn't just another Node.js guide; it's a comprehensive, code-along experience aimed at building a real world product that may be used by thousands of developers. The product that we're going to build will be a backend framework, that too from scratch.

You won't just learn how Node.js works, but also why it operates in a particular way. The guide also includes discussions on relevant data structures and design patterns.

The book also includes a wide range of exercises specifically created to challenge you, that may require commitment and consistent effort on your part. The first exercises start from [chapter 7](/chapters/ch06.5-ex-implementing-a-trie.md)

This guide goes beyond the basics. We're focused on delivering a modular, optimized backend framework that is close to being production-ready. Topics like performance optimization, security measures, and various testing approaches will be covered to ensure the framework is both reliable and extendable.

I highly recommend actively coding alongside this guide, rather than just reading through it, for a full understanding of Node.js and its more intricate aspects.
