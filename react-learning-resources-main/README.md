# React Learning Resources

A curated list of resources to learn React and related web technologies as fast
as possible. The goal is to help you create production quality React apps even
if you are starting from scratch. Just bring plenty of motivation and
perseverance :smile:

If you are curious, this is my preferred React stack:

**Core**

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/) for type safety
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - for building component-based UIs
- [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) &
  [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) for state management

**Foundational libraries**

- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for navigation
- [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) for fetching data using REST
- [Apollo GraphQL](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/) for fetching data using
  GraphQL
- [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) for form handling
- [ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com) - a feature-packed JavaScript grid
- [Highcharts](https://www.highcharts.com) for interactive charts

**Essential tools**

- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to develop UI components in isolation
- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) for unit testing
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for end-to-end testing
- [Mock Service Worker](https://mswjs.io/) to mock HTTP requests
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to format code consistently

I have created the
[React Accelerate template](https://github.com/PublicisSapient/cra-template-accelerate)
to kick-start React apps using the above stack.

## The React Crash Course

This crash course is designed to teach you React and related web technologies as
fast as possible. Feel free to skip any topic that you already know. For video
tutorials, I highly recommend to type along with the instructor to have it sink
in faster.
