# Development Machine Setup for Windows

### Install Chocolatey

[Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) is a universal package manager and
installer for Windows software. We will use it to install the tools and
utilities we need for developing React applications.

> Note: For any reason, if you don't prefer to use Chocolatey, that's ok. Just
> make sure that you install the other recommended packages using your preferred
> installation method.

Follow the steps listed below to install Chocolatey (these are based on the
[installation procedure](https://chocolatey.org/install) described on the
Chocolatey site):

- Open PowerShell as an administrator (Click **Start**, type **PowerShell**,
  right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and then click **Run as administrator**.)

- Ensure that the execution policy is not restricted. Run `Get-ExecutionPolicy`.
  If it returns `Restricted`, then run the following command:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
```

- Now run the following command. (Get this command from
  [Chocolateyâ€™s official installation page](https://chocolatey.org/install#individual)
  in case there are any changes.)

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://community.chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
```

- Wait for a few seconds for the command to complete.

- Shut down and restart PowerShell as an administrator for the installation to
  take effect.

- Type `choco -?` to make sure Chocolatey runs.

- See [Getting Started](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/getting-started) for
  usage instructions and
  [Commands](https://docs.chocolatey.org/en-us/choco/commands/) for a listing of
  CLI commands.

Tip: Always run Chocolatey from PowerShell running as an administrator.

### Install 7-Zip

[7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) is a good open source file archiver.

```bash
choco install 7zip -y
```

### Install Cmder

[Cmder](https://cmder.net/) is a great console emulator for Windows. We will use
the git-for-windows version which includes all Unix commands ready in PATH so
that you can use commands like `git`, `cat` and `ls` instantly on your machine.

```bash
choco install cmdr -y
```

Cmder is installed under C:\tools\cmder. Open this folder in File Explorer. You
will find the Cmder executable here called Cmder.exe. Pin this executable to the
taskbar for ease. Now start Cmder from the taskbar.

By default, Cmder starts at C:\tools\cmder. I prefer having it start at my home
directory (e.g. D:\users\<username>). Follow the steps below to do this.

- Click on the hamburger menu (bottom right) and select Settings.
- In the navigation bar, select Startup > Tasks.
- Under Predefined Tasks, click on {cmd::Cmder}.
- Click the button that says "Startup dir..."
- Select your home directory.
- Click on "Save Settings".

### Install NVM for Windows & Node

NVM for Windows is a utility to manage multiple node.js versions. It is better
than using the Node.js installer or Chocolatey because you can keep multiple
versions of Node on your machine, which is very useful sometimes.

Go to the [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows) repo and
follow the instructions there to install it. Also install the LTS version of
Node (v16.14.0 at the time of this writing).

_In case you don't want to install NVM for Windows, here is the command to
install Node using Chocolatey:_

```bash
choco install nodejs-lts -y
```

### Install Yarn

```bash
choco install yarn -y
```

### Try building a React app

Clone the
[Accelerated News](https://github.com/PublicisSapient/accelerated-news) repo
wherever you keep projects and verify that you can build and run the app. I
recommend keeping all your projects under your home directory, e.g.
`D:\user\<username>\projects`.

Open Cmder and execute the following commands:

```bash
cd projects
git clone https://github.com/PublicisSapient/accelerated-news.git
cd accelerated-news
yarn
yarn start
```

Congratulations! Your machine is now certified to build React apps!

## Install an IDE
